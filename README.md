### Stop scrolling!

It gets a little bit complex down there.

If you are not familiar with governance, and especially decentralised governance, we suggest that you should begin and familiarise themselves with our introductory documents:

1. [**Introduction to Decentralised Governance**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1swd1WtdPkhkVcxF0-efl185506kBld2zIUKvpKp3M_E/edit#heading=h.g1hnv482cbkn)**.**

This document explains how we define governance, and why it is crucial in the management of a decentralised Network.

1. [**Introduction to cheqd**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19_FV8bfeM3ITZIZyTObmvIt2dszqrvtVLP-2AWz8TGo/edit#)

This document explains what cheqd is trying to achieve, and what the intended goal of the Network is.

### Still a bit confused?

We’ve got some super simple videos on our Youtube channel explaining SSI and the objectives of cheqd.

1. [**What is Self-Sovereign Identity?**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9f36Sh4CFM)
2. [**How decentralised identity is used in real life**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX38IhG7OpA)
3. [**Why SSI is a better way**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qObhY0SGsFY)
4. [**How cheqd’s model works and why we chose Cosmos**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAxNUfJ75LI)

And we also have a glossary to help you understand all this technical mumbo jumbo!

[**Glossary of terms**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-gNBDyQxsCsx27KbkXd84H4WNQNB3OnmsjfhN0jeIM/edit)



### Getting into the juicy stuff

Phew! Okay, we’re starting to get up to speed.

Now we’re familiar with decentralised governance and what cheqd are trying to achieve.

Next, we need to explain how our Network actually works and how YOU can get involved with it as either a Node Operator, Users or community member.



### Where do you want your journey with cheqd to take you?

To give you the best experience in understanding how our Network governance works, we have segmented our Governance information into different user stories.

Feel free to select the route that suits you best:

1. [**I want to engage with the cheqd community;**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wa46yKXXtRU7ffLcVNRT-v7kEfLeay5yML5JgFd2Wdk/edit)
2. [**I am a token holder and I want to use my tokens for governance purposes;**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17_N9Fs3j_YOQdVZ3g3OZjOP8zbn5ZUpIHYQFdLC3uMs/edit)
3. [**I want to cheq out the source code**](https://github.com/cheqd)**;**
4. [**I am \(or want to be\) a Node Operator and I want to understand my role and responsibilities.**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wK2oNyIkQIf9di8fVNuh4xHmt7AxIcLl22JEsMnyKAM/edit?pli=1)

### 

### Building on Cosmos

cheqd’s Network is built using the Cosmos SDK, which means that it can inherit a lot of the core functionality of Cosmos.

Notably, for this Governance Framework, we will often refer to specifications laid out in Cosmos’ SDK documentation, [here](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.42/modules/gov/).

Importantly, cheqd is an Application Specific Blockchain. This means that Users of the cheqd Network have full control over the entire chain and are not reliant on Cosmos at all. This ensures the community will not be stuck if, for example, a bug in the Cosmos hub or Inter-Blockchain Communication is discovered, and that it has the entire freedom to choose how it is going to evolve.

However, it is worth noting that once the Network has departed from Cosmos’ initial foundation, it will no longer be able to seamlessly update itself to Cosmos’ latest functionality.

For this reason, it is suggested that the Network mirrors Cosmos’ architecture and updates, especially during the initial stages of its lifecycle.



### Building on Trust over IP

Trust over IP is a Foundation that intends to create an interoperable ecosystem for decentralised identity companies. It does this by segmenting decentralised identity into different stack layers, for different identity components.

The idea is that any ToIP Layer 1 innovation should be able to interoperate with any Layer 2, 3 or 4 innovation.

We love this idea, and want our Network to be agnostic to the technology built on top of it, championing Open Standards and the latest SSI innovations such as BBS+ Credentials and a movement towards a unified Credential Exchange Protocol.

This is a snapshot of the ToIP stack, which many of the SSI community will be familiar with.

If this is new to you and you want to learn more about it, you can take a look at their [new, cool interactive model here](https://trustoverip.org/wp-content/toip-model/).

![](.gitbook/assets/0%20%281%29.png)

**cheqd intends to become a ToIP compliant Layer 1, with the first compliant decentralised governance model.**

Unlike traditional ToIP layers, cheqd will not rely on a centralised Governance Authority to maintain and take responsibility for the Network, nor its governance.

Rather, the Network assumes authority, responsibility and accountability for the Network, as **Entropy increases.**

This means that human accountability will actually be diluted across the Network, tending to a state known as **sufficient decentralisation.**

This can be represented by the following amendment to the stack:

![](.gitbook/assets/1%20%281%29.png)

As an entire stack, this now looks like:

![](.gitbook/assets/2%20%281%29.png)

This better reflects the decentralised nature of cheqd and its Layer 1 Network. We believe that this model is also still compatible with the spirit and intention of the ToIP metamodel, given that it wants to support and facilitate decentralised identity in its multiple forms.

### Terminology

It is important to use consistent and plain language, to ensure that there is a clear understanding of this Governance Framework.

For this reason, this Governance Framework will utilise the key words:

* "MUST",
* "MUST NOT",
* "REQUIRED",
* "SHALL",
* "SHALL NOT",
* "SHOULD",
* "SHOULD NOT",
* "RECOMMENDED",
* "MAY", and
* "OPTIONAL"

in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2119)

The Governance Framework SHALL also make use of the terms, conventions and patterns in the [ToIP Metamodel](https://wiki.trustoverip.org/display/HOME/ToIP+Governance+Metamodel+Specification).

cheqd-specific Terms SHALL be defined in the [**Glossary of terms**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G-gNBDyQxsCsx27KbkXd84H4WNQNB3OnmsjfhN0jeIM/edit), a Controlled Document of the Governance Framework.

### Governing and Administrative Authority

The cheqd Network is not governed by a centralised Governing or Administrative Authority. Rather, the consensus of the Network will act as its own Governance Authority.

cheqd is a Public Permissionless Network, which means that there is no gatekeeping for enabling Users to utilise the Network.

Unlike many other Governance Frameworks for digital identity, cheqd allows Proposals and prospective updates to be decided, via a public vote, on the Network. Proposals can be made by holders of our token, the cheq, and votes can be made on a 1 vote - 1 token basis. This functionality enables the Network to self-govern, relying on the architecture it is based on.

As previously mentioned in this Governance Framework, this is known as decentralised governance, since the direction of change on the Network is made by the consensus of a collective group, rather than the voice of a few.

### Summary of Default Governance Parameters

### Revisions

Revisions to this documentation can be made through the following process:

1. Revisions via Github pull requests or forks of the code;
2. 2 week review period by cheqd community and maintainers, in line with the Code of Conduct and Foundational Principles;
3. Proposal to the Network to approve or reject updates on a rolling bi-monthly basis.

### Extensions

\(Complete when Github is up and running and agreed upon\)

This section applies to GFs that permit extensions via the incorporation of other GFs \(a common feature of some ecosystem GFs\). It:

1. MUST state whether the GF can be extended.
2. MUST specify the requirements an Extension Governance Framework must meet in order to be approved.
3. MUST specify the process for an Extension Governance Framework to be approved.
4. MUST define an authoritative mechanism for registration and activation of an approved Extension Governance Framework.
5. MUST define the requirements for notification of the Trust Community about an approved Extension Governance Framework.

### Trust Assurance and Certification

Rather than having a formal audit, certification and compliance programme upheld by rules, cheqd Network compliance will be upheld by Principles and Social Norms, Markets and Economy, and Architecture, enforced by the Network itself.

Punishment for non-compliance is built into the fabric of cheqd, through the use of the CHEQ token. Users may gain or lose tokens based on their actions on the Network.

### Risk Assessment

This category includes links to an ISO 27005 \(or compatible\) risk assessment for managing risk. Controlled Documents in this category:

* SHOULD identify key risks that MAY negatively affect the achievement of the GF's purpose and objectives within its Scope.
* SHOULD include a Risk Assessment process output that provides an assessment of each key risk that the GF is designed to address and mitigate.
* SHOULD assess which Roles and Processes are vulnerable to each risk and how they are affected.
* MAY include a Risk Treatment Plan \(RTP\) for how identified risks are treated \(e.g. mitigated, avoided, accepted or transferred\); however, all risks that are to be mitigated by Mandates in the GF SHOULD be identified.

1. [**cheqd’s Constitution and Principles**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NafjSVg4lWAJ1BscqlUfnThGNuM9jkUt6wGt8Zju2Y0/edit)

YOU SHOULD familiarise yourself with the cheqd Constitution and Principles before using the Network.

Any decision that is made on-chain, affecting the cheqd Network, must adhere to cheqd’s Constitution and Principles. The cheqd constitution acts as a checks and balances against amendments made on the Network.

The Principles also advise participants in cheqd governance when to use their ‘veto’ vote, which should be used when there is a contradiction between a Proposal and a Principle.

1. **How our token, the cheq, enables an incentivised Network**
2. [**Node Operator Terms of Service**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wK2oNyIkQIf9di8fVNuh4xHmt7AxIcLl22JEsMnyKAM/edit?pli=1)

Any Node Operator on the cheqd Network must read, understand and accept the Terms of Service. This document lays out the respective potential liability and accountability, during the early stages of the cheqd Network, before it has reached **sufficient decentralisation**.

### Business Requirements

These are the requirements governing the business model\(s\) and business rules to be followed by the Trust Community. Controlled Documents in this category:

1. SHOULD clearly explain the exchange\(s\) of value within the Trust Community for which the GF is designed.
2. SHOULD define the Policies and/or Rules governing how and when these exchanges of value take place.
3. SHOULD define the Requirements for the use of any Decision Support Systems.
4. SHOULD define how all Trust Community Members will be held accountable for their actions in these exchanges.
5. SHOULD define how the Governing Authority, Governing Entity, and the GF are sustainable under these Requirements.

### Technical Requirements

These are the Requirements governing technical interoperability. Controlled Documents in this category:

1. MUST specify how Members of the Trust Community will interoperate technically using the ToIP Technology Stack by reference to ToIP Standard Specifications \(TSS\).
2. SHOULD \(if necessary\) reference one or more specific ToIP Interoperability Profiles \(TIPs\).
3. SHOULD specify any Specifications that are specific to this Trust Community.

### Legal Agreements

This category includes any legal agreements or contracts included in the GF. Controlled Documents in this category:

1. MUST include all specified legal agreements or contracts between Members and/or the Governing Authority.
2. SHOULD reference the Glossary document for all terms not defined internally to the agreement or contract.
3. MUST clearly state the Governed Parties to whom these legal agreements apply.
4. MUST define or reference all relevant accountability and enforcement mechanisms.
5. SHOULD reference any other relevant Requirements in the balance of the GF.

### General Requirements

1. SHOULD include the Requirements that:
   1. Apply generally to governance of the entire Trust Community;
   2. Apply to the structure of the GF, e.g., what Controlled Documents must be specified by whom and applied to whom.
   3. Guide the development of more specific Requirements within the Controlled Documents.
2. SHOULD NOT include Requirements that apply only within the context of a specific category addressed by one of the Controlled Documents.
3. MUST include Responsible Use Policies that apply generally to infrastructure governed by the GF.
4. MUST include any Regulatory Compliance Policies that are not specified within particular Controlled Documents.
5. SHOULD include any Code of Conduct that applies broadly within the ecosystem, if any.
