# House rules

### **House rules**

The Primary Document of this Governance Framework, the cheqbook, is intended to lay out clearly and in plain language how cheqd governance is structured.

Through this Primary Document, WE want to help YOU as a Network User, Node Operator or cheqd Community Member understand and familiarise yourselves with the following:

1. What Governance \(and decentralised governance\) is;
2. What cheqd’s mission is, and how our Network functions;
3. How you can impact Network Governance, either in off-chain forums, or through on-chain Proposals;
4. How the cheqd Network rewards participants through transaction fees and rewards;
5. What Principles YOU SHOULD uphold while using the cheqd Network;
6. The potential liability and accountability during the early stages of the Network’s development, during a period we refer to as ‘Low Entropy’.

In return, we kindly ask that YOU, while using the cheqd Network:

1. Demonstrate empathy and kindness toward other people;
2. Act with openness and respect to Users of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences;
3. Give and gracefully accept constructive feedback
4. Accept responsibility for your mistakes, and are open to apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
5. Focus on what is best not just for YOU and your desired outcomes on the Network, but make decisions with the entire community in mind. 

If you have any questions regarding the way Governance is structured, please reach out to one of our Community leaders and/or email [governace@cheqd.io](mailto:governace@cheqd.io)  


Let’s together make cheqd a success, and payment rails for authentic dataverified, digital identity a global standard: improving trust and efficiency in every industry.
