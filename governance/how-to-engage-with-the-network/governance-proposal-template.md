## **Description**

A longer &lt;500 description of the changes you want to make, making direct references to where you want to make changes from, using links.

For example:

_{_

_I want to change the cheqd Proposal Template because it misses a section on X. This amendment would make the process of making Proposals smoother for the entire community._

_The cheqd Proposal Template I am referring to in this Proposal can be found here:_

[_https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSvevtJV1DXjOu30Y-sjWZmzRZPpkSIhM2HZm24Fwwo/edit\#_](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSvevtJV1DXjOu30Y-sjWZmzRZPpkSIhM2HZm24Fwwo/edit#)

 }

## **Consequences**

This section describes the resulting context, after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed here, not just the "positive" ones. A particular decision may have positive, negative, and neutral consequences, but all of them affect the community and project in the future.

#### **Positive**

{positive consequences}

#### Negative

{negative consequences}

#### **Neutral**

{neutral consequences}

### **Backwards Compatibility**

All Governance Proposals that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The Proposal must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. Proposal submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility explanation may be rejected outright.

An example of incompatibility would be a movement away from Cosmos, which would fork the Network into its own, more autonomous entity.

This would preclude cheqd from seamlessly upgrading its architecture in tandem with Cosmosâ€™ updates.

This is an undesirable outcome until the Network has gained sufficient traction, uptake and community activity.
